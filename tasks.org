#+STARTUP: indent overview
#+TODO: TODO DEFER | DONE

* DONE [5/5] Version 0.1.0
- Just one contract, enough to check how to do the basics.
- Some details copied and modified from GAP.
  
** DONE Add Agencies, Contract Groups, basic mod structure
** DONE Add KACA agency logo from NACA
** DONE Add KASA agency logo from NASA
** DONE Add Makefile build and test system
** DONE Add first contract type and fix bugs

* TODO [0/4] Version 0.2.0

** TODO Add all GAP milestone contracts
- Including Heli and Seaplane too
** TODO Would it make sense to group all K-Planes groups into one?
** TODO Add reward scaling
- Based on distance/speed/altitude  
** TODO Add atmosphere scaling
- Based on Stock, 2.5/2.7 or RSS scaling
- Troposphere, Stratosphere, Karman Line/Space
** TODO Look at generated milestone contracts from shorter meta-data
- Probably a lot of repetition, can this be done in ContractConfigurator?
** TODO How to do distance? Somebody has probably done this?
- Parameter X with ReachState Prelaunch
- Behaviour B which is triggered when X is satisfied (plane about to launch)
  - This because stores the LaunchSite location in data
- Parameter C triggered when distance to location exceeded, not sure if this is
  possible.
- Alternative: Use Waypoint Generator to create waypoint with suitable min/max distance from launch
  site. This might be better as it gives a target to aim for and return from.
** TODO Add automated GitHub release
** TODO Add CKAN information
** TODO Add automated SpaceDock release
