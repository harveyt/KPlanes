#+TITLE: K-Planes Tasks
#+STARTUP: indent overview
#+TODO: TODO DEFER | DONE

* DONE [5/5] Version 0.1.0
- Just one contract, enough to check how to do the basics.
- Some details copied and modified from GAP.
  
** DONE Add Agencies, Contract Groups, basic mod structure
** DONE Add KACA agency logo from NACA
** DONE Add KASA agency logo from NASA
** DONE Add Makefile build and test system
** DONE Add first contract type and fix bugs

* TODO [0/4] Version 0.2.0

** TODO Add all GAP milestone contracts
- Including Heli and Seaplane too
** TODO Would it make sense to group all K-Planes groups into one?
** TODO Add reward scaling
- Based on distance/speed/altitude  
** TODO Add atmosphere scaling
- Based on Stock, 2.5/2.7 or RSS scaling
- Troposphere, Stratosphere, Karman Line/Space
** TODO Ensure craft do not miuse parachutes
- Parachutes can only be used after landing.
** TODO Look at generated milestone contracts from shorter meta-data
- Probably a lot of repetition, can this be done in ContractConfigurator?
** TODO How to do distance?
- Use Waypoint Generator to create waypoint with suitable min/max distance from launch
  site.
- For pole :: must reach pole waypoint and return to KSC
- For around the world :: place waypoint 90 W, 270 W on equator then return to
  KSC
- Possibly calculate great circle with start point and 90 W?
** TODO How to do air launch?
- Allow one staging event
- Before staging, whole craft is validated
- Staging must occur:
  - Above a certain height
  - Remaining craft is then validated again
- Player must also land other aircraft
** TODO How to do payload delivery?
- Allow one staging event
- Must occur above a certain height
- Primary craft is validated
- Secondary craft can be made of anything, but must exceed payload mass
- Player must land primary
** TODO Add automated GitHub release
** TODO Add CKAN information
** TODO Add automated SpaceDock release

Key:

*M* :: Mountain biome and landed at >1000m, can use plane or helicopter
*1* :: Flying High + 1/9th
*2* :: Third way between Flying High to Space (70 - 18) / 3 + 18 == 35)
*3* :: Three quarters Flying High to Space (70 - 18) * 0.75 + 18 = 57)
*4* :: Circumference of home world, great circle from location through pole or
*equator at 90 degrees West (following sun)
*5* :: Similar to Around The World but only electric engines. Allow RTG, Solar, Batteries
and Nuclear.
