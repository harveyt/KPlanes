#+TITLE: K-Planes Tasks
#+STARTUP: indent overview
#+TODO: TODO DEFER | DONE

* DONE [5/5] Version 0.1.0
- Just one contract, enough to check how to do the basics.
- Some details copied and modified from GAP.
  
** DONE Add Agencies, Contract Groups, basic mod structure
** DONE Add KACA agency logo from NACA
** DONE Add KASA agency logo from NASA
** DONE Add Makefile build and test system
** DONE Add first contract type and fix bugs

* TODO [15/23] Version 0.2.0

** DONE Add all GAP milestone contracts
- Including Heli and Seaplane too
- Not yet converted to planet agnostic
** DONE Would it make sense to group all K-Planes groups into one?
** DONE Generate milestone contracts from ContractTable.csv
- Use python
- Add to build system
** DONE Add reward scaling
- Based on distance/speed/altitude  
** DONE Move data into Groups sub-dir
** DONE Agent names have to be real names, not ids.
** DONE Only add Agent if one with same name does not exist.
- &AGENT[KASA]:LAST[KPlanes]
** DONE Why is second contract not acceptable?
** DONE Better format for altitude
- AltMin = 1000 (double)
- NameAltMin = Troposhere Low
- PrettyAltMin = "10km (Troposphere Low)"
- AltMax similar
- PrettyAltLimits =
  - AltMin only :: "above 10km (Troposphere Low)"
  - AltMax only :: not allowed, either min or min/max
  - AltMin & AltMax :: "between 10km and 20km (Troposphere Low)"
    - Latter name is taken from min
- Use similar for SpeedMin/SpeedMax, DistMin, DistMax
  - Use names for speeds: Mach1
  - Use names for distance: ShortHop, Domestic, Continental, Intercontinental,
    Polar, CircumnavigatePolar, Circumnavigate
** DONE Ensure localized strings use Pretty versions
"asdasd".Format(...)
- How to do this?
** DONE Add atmosphere scaling
- Based on Stock, 2.5/2.7 or RSS scaling
- Troposphere, Stratosphere, Karman Line/Space
** DONE Better height definitions:

- SpaceLEO :: Uses the ISS height, since LEO is actually 140 to 2000 in real world.

** DONE Change requirements in table to be just contract name (so more can be added)
** DONE Change reward scale to seperate coloumns: Funds, Science and Reputation
- These are values assuming scale = 1, so easy to balance
- Take them from existing contracts
** DONE Move "Mid Stage" to right of Style, as "Style Param"
- For Land - is a Biome, "Mountain" or "Hovering" are special
** TODO Change most speed records to absolute values
- Rather than Mach 1 which is height dependant
- Possibly have Mach 1, Mach 3 and Mach 5 as targets but very fixed for altitude
  (where they make sense) with equivalent surface speed
- To emulate X-1, X-15, SR-71 style records
** TODO Add basic GAP contracts
- Script to extra description/title/notes/synopsis into loc file and fix br.
** TODO Ensure craft do not misuse parachutes
- Parachutes can only be used after landing.
** TODO How to do distance?
- Use Waypoint Generator to create waypoint with suitable min/max distance from launch
  site.
- For pole :: must reach pole waypoint and return to KSC
- For around the world :: place waypoint 90 W, 270 W on equator then return to
  KSC
- Possibly calculate great circle with start point and 90 W?
** TODO How to do air launch?
- Allow one staging event
- Before staging, whole craft is validated
- Staging must occur:
  - Above a certain height
  - Remaining craft is then validated again
- Player must also land other aircraft
** TODO How to do payload delivery?
- Allow one staging event
- Must occur above a certain height
- Primary craft is validated
- Secondary craft can be made of anything, but must exceed payload mass
- Player must land primary
** TODO Add automated GitHub release
** TODO Add CKAN information
** TODO Add automated SpaceDock release
