		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_001_FirstFlight_title = Build and fly your first airplane!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_001_FirstFlight_description = Thanks to your organization's research efforts, we have finally developed an air-breathing engine that should be light enough to mount to a glider, making controlled powered air flight possible!\n\nPrevious attempts to use solid rockets for gliders often ended in disaster and a scarcity of willing volunteers.  Wright Aeronautical is asking you to partner with them to build and test a flying machine using an air breathing engine. Your flying machine must have wings so it can control its flight, and must be able to land safely.\n\nThis is a whole new frontier where many have failed before, so there isn't any investment money available to offer you at the moment. Wright Aeronautical is willing to cover labor costs, snacks, and notify the press, however, you will need to put forth your own funds to acquire the parts necessary for this project. If you succeed, your pilot will acquire both valuable flying skills and your organization will become known worldwide.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_001_FirstFlight_synopsis = It's time to construct a flying machine - one that will prove to the world that controlled powered air flight is indeed possible!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_001_FirstFlight_notes = Wilbur and Orville both wanted to go, but the coin they flipped landed on its side - hence the reason why they're also asking you to put up a volunteer to pilot the contraption.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_001_FirstFlight_completedMessage = Congratulations! The flight was a success!\n\nThe historic flight was thankfully caught on camera by the lone press agent who responded to the press invitation. His article about your flight has been read by millions, and you have now spurred the imaginations of Kerbals everywhere.

		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_002_FlyingHigher_title = Fly an airplane to an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_002_FlyingHigher_description = Taking off and landing is easy. Flying at an @/PrettyAltRange with an air-breathing engine and landing back at the runway... is an entirely different matter. Wilbur Kerman says runways are the roads of the future, and says your pilots might as well get used to landing on one.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_002_FlyingHigher_synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly to an @/PrettyAltRange, then land back at the runway safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_002_FlyingHigher_notes = Enjoy the view!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_002_FlyingHigher_completedMessage = Another historic flight completed!\n\nYour pilot is starting to showing some amazing skill with that last landing.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_003_FlyingFaster_title = Achieve an airspeed of @/PrettySpeed.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_003_FlyingFaster_description = Kurtis Kerman, a friend of Wilbur Kerman, suggests that an airplane, if designed properly, should be able to exceed speeds faster than the fastest ground vehicles, and without having to dive toward the ground to do it. Wright Aeronautical is interested in helping to prove that this is possible (we're hoping you know which "this" we're referring to). They want you to take an air-breathing airplane to an @PrettyAltRange and see if you can acheive a @/PrettySpeed safely in level controlled flight, and thus break the current manned vehicle speed record.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_003_FlyingFaster_synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, flying at an @PrettyAltRange, with a @/PrettySpeed in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.	
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_003_FlyingFaster_notes = Let's get flying!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_003_FlyingFaster_completedMessage = Congratulations, you have set a new air speed record at a @/PrettySpeed!\n\nYou have justified Kurtis Kerman's theories on high speed air flight, and brought another measure of fame and reputation to Wright Aeronautical. Sponsors are starting to ask how they can support the new air speed frontier. Check in with Mission Control to see if Wright Aeronautical has another contract waiting for you!

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_004_Seaplane_title = Build and fly a seaplane!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_004_Seaplane_description = You've proven the airworthiness of your aircraft so far. But can you modify it or design an aircraft that can land on water? We want you to attempt an aviation first - landing an airplane on water, and taking back off again. Our engineers would like to call such an idea a seaplane, and they think it will really be useful to a number of organizations at KSC if the idea can be proven.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_004_Seaplane_synopsis = Land a seaplane on the surface of the water at the waypoint, and take off again and land back at KSC.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_004_Seaplane_notes = Your craft must be an airplane that can land on water horizontally and take off again.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_004_Seaplane_completedMessage = Congratulations on another aviation first! You have propelled your organization to one of the most popular organizations. We have credited your account with a share of funds from various investors who are excited about your organization's future.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_005_Helicopter_title = Land on a helipad!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_005_Helicopter_description = We want you to test your first helicopter or Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) prototype. Land on one of the available helipads.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_005_Helicopter_synopsis = For science (and a few funds)!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_005_Helicopter_notes = Make a helicopter or VTOL and land on a VAB or Administration Building helipad!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_005_Helicopter_completedMessage = Flight Completed! And you're still alive, which is even better since most helicopter and other VTOL test flights have been fatal.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_006_ShortHop_title = Travel @/PrettyDistanceRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_006_ShortHop_description = Now you can fly high and fast, perhaps we should see how far you can go, and of course come back again safely. Travel to the half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance and return back to the KSC, while keeping an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_006_ShortHop_synopsis = Travel to half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance, then land back at KSC safely. Make sure to keep an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_006_ShortHop_notes = You might want to check your fuel guages first. Do not go too high.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_006_ShortHop_completedMessage = Wow, we did not know people wanted to travel so far from home. Perhaps we can make money from taking people to other places?

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_007_TroposphereHigh_title = Fly an airplane to @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_007_TroposphereHigh_description = Orville Kerman says it should be possible now to attempt an altitude record of @/PrettyAltRange in an air-breathing airplane. He said Wright Aeronautical is aware that a local newspaper is offering a reward to any organization that will be the first to achieve a @/PrettyAltRange flying altitude, and he thinks your organization may be up to the task.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_007_TroposphereHigh_synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly up to @/PrettyAltRange, then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_007_TroposphereHigh_notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude things on the ground really start to look small!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_007_TroposphereHigh_completedMessage = You flew @/PrettyAltRange and you didn't hit a bird! Great job!\n\nUnfortunatley, hitting a bird was what the last pilot to attempt this challenge said before he spiraled out of control from just under @/PrettyAltRange and left a crater near the Administration Building.\n\nAs Gene Kerman makes preparations to turn the crater into a memorial pond for aviation pioneers, both Orville Kerman and Inigma Kerman congratulate you on returning safely. There is a challenge waiting for you back at Mission Control if you're interested.


		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_008_DomesticDistance_title = Travel @/PrettyDistanceRange
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_008_DomesticDistance_description = Passengers want to go further, perhaps to the sea side or some other city. Travel to the half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance and return to the KSC.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_008_DomesticDistance_synopsis = Travel to half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance, then land back at KSC safely. Make sure to keep an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_008_DomesticDistance_notes = You're gonna need a bigger plane (and fuel tanks).
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_008_DomesticDistance_completedMessage = Phew, that was a long way. Next time pack some entertainment, or perhaps look into autopilots.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_009_AirspeedRecord_title = Achieve an airspeed of @/PrettySpeed
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_009_AirspeedRecord_description = Kurtis Kerman, now a fellow engineer with Wright Aeronautical, thinks that with additional tweaking of existing aircraft design, that it may be possible to exceed @/PrettySpeed in level flight. A number of sponsors have given us some money to make it happen, and Inigma Kerman is more than happy to funnel all of it to Wright Aeronautical and on to your organization if you accept this contract!\n\nAttempting high speed flying though is not for the faint of heart. Some pilots have reported serious shimmies with their aircraft when approaching high speeds during dives, and some airplanes have broken up due to aerodynamic forces when exceeding @/PrettySpeed. Inigma wants you to be the first to take an air-breathing airplane to an @/PrettyAltRange and exceed @/PrettySpeed in level controlled flight, and return safely. Doing so will give the sponsors a pretty decent return on their investment and funds in your pocket.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_009_AirspeedRecord_synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly to an @/PrettyAltRange, exceed @/PrettySpeed in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_009_AirspeedRecord_notes = Let's get flying!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_009_AirspeedRecord_completedMessage = Congratulations, you have set a new airspeed record of @/PrettySpeed and returned alive! There are more aircraft challenges waiting for you back at Mission Control if you're interested.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_010_ContinentalDistance_title = Long haul flights of @/PrettyDistanceRange
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_010_ContinentalDistance_description = Travelling across continents might be useful for flying back our intrepid astronauts, or for business people who simply have to be there. Travel to the half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance and return to the KSC.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_010_ContinentalDistance_synopsis = Travel to half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance, then land back at KSC safely. Make sure to keep an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_010_ContinentalDistance_notes = Fuel in wings? Fuel under wings? Drop fuel from wings? So much fuel!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_010_ContinentalDistance_completedMessage = So far! Definitely need to invest in in-flight entertainment systems.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_011_Mountaineer_title = Land on a mountain top!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_011_Mountaineer_description = Landing on mountains may be useful for rescuing Kerbals who returned from space and landed in strange places. Alternatively we might find interesting views or creatures up there. Fly into the mountains and land @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_011_Mountaineer_synopsis = Fly to the mountains and land @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_011_Mountaineer_notes = Probably better to use VTOL or helicopter.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_011_Mountaineer_completedMessage = Well that was precarious!

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_012_IntercontinentalDistance_title = Extreme long distance flights of @/PrettyDistanceRange
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_012_IntercontinentalDistance_description = Holiday seem popular, but for some reason they are more appealing if they are on a different continent. The only problem is that these are quite far away. Having enough fuel and patience to last the distance will be challenge. Travel to the half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance and return to the KSC.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_012_IntercontinentalDistance_synopsis = Travel to half-way distance marker at @/PrettyMarkerDistance, then land back at KSC safely. Make sure to keep an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_012_IntercontinentalDistance_notes = Your plane may well be made entirely of fuel tanks. Bigger wings, bigger engines, bigger landing legs, bigger budgets.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Start_012_IntercontinentalDistance_completedMessage = So the other continents look much like this one, but are warmer or colder. Not sure flying so far is good for Kerbals.

		// ================================================================================
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_001_StratosphereLow_title = Fly an airplane to @/PrettyAltMin@/DescAltMin.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_001_StratosphereLow_description = Inigma Kerman wants you to design and fly an aircraft capable of operating at an @/PrettyAltRange. He says that such an accomplishment will make future air travel safer since most of the serious weather only happens below this altitude. He says that if pilots could simply fly over bad weather rather than through it, it would unlock a large number of regional and possibly global air travel possibilities.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_001_StratosphereLow_synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly up to an @/PrettyAltRange, then land back at KSC safely. Make sure to keep an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_001_StratosphereLow_notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude the clouds (if any are seen today) will mostly be below your aircraft!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_001_StratosphereLow_completedMessage = You did it! An @/PrettyAltRange reached, and your pilot snapped a great picture!\n\nWhile your pilot rests up at the Astronaut Complex, be sure to check in with Gene at Mission Control for another opportunity if interested.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_002_Mach1_title = Achieve an airspeed of @/PrettySpeed.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_002_Mach1_description = Our aerospace chief scientist Mach Kerman, and KSP retired test pilot Yeager Kerman, want to push us toward developing a spaceplane. But before this can happen, Inigma Kerman says they need to master supersonic flight, and to do this, he is asking your organization to design a plane that can break through the sound barrier in level flight at an @/PrettyAltRange.\n\nAlthough not required to complete this challenge, Mach Kerman believes that if you design an airplane to use one of the new liquid fueled rocket engines being developed for use by the space program, might make this attempt easier to accomplish.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_002_Mach1_synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly with an @/PrettyAltRange, exceed @/PrettySpeed in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_002_Mach1_notes = No one has ever gone faster than the speed of sound before, so most scientists and engineers are at a loss as to give you any useful advice. Even if they could, they're afraid you'd be traveling to fast to hear it anyways.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_002_Mach1_completedMessage = You have broken the sound barrier and achieved the amazing speed of Mach 1! Don't worry, we're sure it can be fixed back up in a jiffy for the next guy!

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_003_StratosphereHigh_title = Fly an airplane to @/PrettyAltMin@/DescAltMin.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_003_StratosphereHigh_description = Maculator Kerman has another challenge for you, this time one that could very well unlock opportunities for regular global air travel - achieve a flying at an @/PrettyAltRange. He says accomplishing such a flying altitude will prove that even the highest mountains can be flown over, which would unlock nearly any destination by air!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_003_StratosphereHigh_synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly at an @/PrettyAltRange, then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_003_StratosphereHigh_notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude the curvature of the planet will be clearly visible!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_003_StratosphereHigh_completedMessage = You did it! @/PrettyAltMin!\n\nA number of opportunities have opened up now that global air travel is just on the horizon of possibility. Check back in with Mission Control for a new contract opportunities!

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_004_Mach2_title = Achieve an airspeed of @/PrettySpeed.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_004_Mach2_description = Mach Kerman believes with current liquid-fueled rocket technology, that it's possible to exceed Mach 2, which is twice the speed of sound. Doing so would bring us another step closer to spaceplane development. He wants you to take an airplane to an @/PrettyAltRange and see if you can exceed @/PrettySpeed safely in level controlled flight.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_004_Mach2_synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly at an @/PrettyAltRange, exceed @/PrettySpeed in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_004_Mach2_notes = Going Mach 1 was cool. Going Mach 2 will be even cooler. Unfortunately, scientists at KSC predict it will also lead to twice the number of required autographs when you get back.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_004_Mach2_completedMessage = Wow! You did it! You reached Mach 2, and came back safely!\n\nInigma passed your flight data to Gene Kerman at the Kerbal Space Program, and Gene says he's very proud of your accomplishments, and that he's very glad to have you working together.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_005_StratosphericJet_title = Fly an jet airplane to @/PrettyAltMin@/DescAltMin
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_005_StratosphericJet_description = Our aerospace chief scientist Mach Kerman, and KSP retired test pilot Yeager Kerman now say that using rockets to go fast is sort of cheating. Try to fly at an @/PrettyAltRange and velocity of @/PrettySpeed only using jet engines in level controlled flight.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_005_StratosphericJet_synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly at an @/PrettyAltRange, exceed @/PrettySpeed in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_005_StratosphericJet_notes = This may require more advanced technology, so you may have to bug the Research and Development department.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_005_StratosphericJet_completedMessage = Jet planes need much less fuel! This will certainly open up vacations, ahem, scientific studies on the other side of the world.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_006_ToTheNorthPole_title = Fly to the North Pole and back.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_006_ToTheNorthPole_description = Given we can fly such a long way, Jebediah Kerman wants to go see what is at the North Pole, and then come back again. Supposedly there's solid ice to land on, and strange creatures, fierce winds, bitter cold and a host of other things that would discourage more sensible Kerbals from going there.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_006_ToTheNorthPole_synopsis = Follow the helpful Markers 1 through 3 in order.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_006_ToTheNorthPole_notes = Wrapping up warm might be an idea. Carrying enough snacks and fuel is going to be tricky.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_006_ToTheNorthPole_completedMessage = Brrrr! That was indeed very cold, but beautiful place to visit. Lets never go again.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_007_MesosphereLow_title = Fly an airplane to @/PrettyAltMin@/DescAltMin.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_007_MesosphereLow_description = The Kerbal Space Program have selected your organization to receive special funding to design and fly an aircraft that will reach the upper atmospheric height of @/PrettyAltRange. Inigma Kerman explains that accomplishing this feat will open up the exciting frontier of spaceplane development!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_007_MesosphereLow_synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly at an @/PrettyAltRange, then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_007_MesosphereLow_notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude you will feel as if you are touching the very boundary of space!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_007_MesosphereLow_completedMessage = You did it! Reaching the dizzy heights at an @/PrettyAltRange. The air was really thin up there, wasn't it? No worries, we have fresh air back at Mission Control.\n\nGreat job! The Spaceplane Frontier is opened!

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_008_Mach3_title = Achieve an airspeed of @/PrettySpeed.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_008_Mach3_description = Gene Kerman wants us to develop supersonic aircraft for use by the space program. Inigma Kerman wants to use this as an opportunity to take another step toward the development of a spaceplane, and impress Gene with another success. Therefore, Inigma is asking your organization to attempt a supersonic test flight exceeding Mach 3 by taking an airplane to an @/PrettyAltRange and exceeding @/PrettySpeed in a level, and controlled flight. Mach Kerman has informed us that this is not going to be easy as thermal effects are expected at this speed, but everyone believes achieving this milestone necessary for the development of a spaceplane which will need to fly far faster than Mach 3 to be successful.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_008_Mach3_synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly at an @/PrettyAltRange, exceed @/PrettySpeed in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_008_Mach3_notes = Mach 3 is definitely not cool. IN fact, it's the threshold of the flames of fire. The aerodynamic forces attacking your plane will be relentless, and unforgiving. Send a brave pilot who you know will keep his cool in flight.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_008_Mach3_completedMessage = Incredible! You have achieved Mach 3!\n\nInigma Kerman says this flight brings the spaceplane program one crucial step toward reality, and also comes with some significant funds from the Kerbal Space Program who will benefit from your flight data.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_009_AroundThePoles_title = Fly to the North Pole then to the South Pole.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_009_AroundThePoles_description = Jebediah Kerman enjoyed the North Pole so much, he thinks we should do both the North and South Pole in one trip. Madness. The engineers have no idea where to put all the fuel, let alone snacks for such a long journey. Refueling a long the way would make sense, if that is possible.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_009_AroundThePoles_synopsis = Follow the helpful Markers 1 through 3 in order. Make sure to keep an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_009_AroundThePoles_notes = No idea where all the fuel needed will come from.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_009_AroundThePoles_completedMessage = Going around the world was quite boring. Possibly taking in-flight enterainment will help next time? Either that or go to sleep... so long as you remember to turn on the autopilot.
		
		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_010_AroundTheWorld_title = Fly around the world!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_010_AroundTheWorld_description = Our engineers think that going around the world in an airplane will be the pinnacle of long distance travel, and will generate such amazing publicity that we will never run out of funds ever again. However Gene Kerman thinks that going all that distance just to come back again is pretty silly. Whatever pays the bills though.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_010_AroundTheWorld_synopsis = Follow the helpful Markers 1 through 3 in order. Make sure to keep an @/PrettyAltRange.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_010_AroundTheWorld_notes = No idea where all the fuel needed will come from.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_010_AroundTheWorld_completedMessage = Going around the world was quite boring. Possibly having decent in-flight catering and very comfortable beds will help next time? Either that or watch lots of movies.
		
		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_011_MesosphereHigh_title = Fly an airplane to @/PrettyAltMin@/DescAltMin.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_011_MesosphereHigh_description = The Kerbal Space Program wants us to be the first to develop a spaceplane for use in its space program. Inigma Kerman already had you on speed dial, and is currently asking your organization to lead this cutting edge effort.\n\nInigma says that you will need to develop a spaceplane - one that will be able to fly to the highest reaches of the atmosphere, and land on the ground safely. It's not that hard to say that an @/PrettyAltRange is a mere skip away from space. He says the Kerbal Space Program has already given authorization to make this a suborbital flight if desired - assuming you can engineer your spaceplane to do so, but it's not required to complete the mission.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_011_MesosphereHigh_synopsis = Simply launch a spaceplane from the runway and fly to an @/PrettyAltRange and then land your spaceplane anywhere on the ground safely. You may use an air-breathing engine, or liquid fueled engine, or both.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_011_MesosphereHigh_notes = High above the ground, where space meets the air, and the stars beckon, will you realize that the universe is at your fingertips. That is, if Kerbals even have fingers other than their thumbs.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_011_MesosphereHigh_completedMessage = Your spaceplane mission was a success! Mission Control erupted in celebration when you flew at @/PrettyAltMin, and again when you landed. There are compliments all around, and your organization has been honored with a fairly large reward.

		// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_012_Mach4_title = Achieve an airspeed of @/PrettySpeed.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_012_Mach4_description = Gene Kerman wants to see if your organization can pull off the final leg of the air speed program, and gather data for aircraft thermal effects and handling of an aircraft at high supersonic speed. What speed? Mach 4. Inigma Kerman told Gene that us that we can do it. He wants you to take up this final airspeed challenge and see if you can get an aircraft to achieve @/PrettySpeed flying at an @/PrettyAltRange, in level flight. If it can be done, then it opens the door to developing a spaceplane prototype in the near future.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_012_Mach4_synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly at an @/PrettyAltRange, exceed @/PrettySpeed in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land and stop anywhere safely.
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_012_Mach4_notes = Four times the speed of sound doesn't sound...er seem that much more than three times the speed of sound. That is, unless you're a meteor, which at some point in this mission someone on the ground might mistake you for one. Good luck!
		#autoLOC_KPlanes_Early_012_Mach4_completedMessage = Congratulations! You have achieved Mach 4!\n\nGene says the Kerbal Space Program and its affiliates are serious about reaching space via a spaceplane, and will look to your organization to make it happen soon.
